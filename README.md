# Atlas - Lightweight Ranked-choice election system

## What

Atlas is an open-source tool to conduct authenticated ranked-choice elections. The administrator can choose candidates, who authenticated voters can rank in order of their choice. When the administrator chooses to tabulate the votes, a [ranked-choice instant runoff]() election is conducted, and the winner is declared.

The uses of this framework are limited only by your voter base and imagination. As of now, the planned use-case is to deploy atlas as a decision framework for upcoming livestream/event topics. 

## How

_Deliberate on the Tech Stack here._

Proposed - 

**Backend** Flask, with a persistent data store (SQLite?)
**Frontend** React
**Authenticator** Custom authenticator based on Github Repo of members, possible OAuth?
